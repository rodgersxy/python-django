# FEATURE OF OOP(Object oriented programming):  

What is OOPS?  

Object Oriented Programming language is a methodology which uses the concept of class and object   
```
    Class
    Object
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstract class
```

## What is Inheritance in Python:   

Inheritance, in general, is the passing of properties to someone. In programming languages, the concept of inheritance comes with classes.
   
    Creating new classes from already existing classes is called inheritance.   
    The existing class is called a super class or base class or parent class.   
    The new class is called a subclass or derived class or child class.   
    Inheritance allows sub classes to inherit the variables, methods and constructors of their   super class.   

### Advantages of Inheritance:   

    The main advantage of inheritance is code re-usability.  
    Time taken for application development will be less.  
    Redundancy (repetition) of the code can be reduced.
