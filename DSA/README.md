# DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON:  

* Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data efficiently in computer memory for effective access and modification.  

* Algorithms: Step by step instructions to solve a problem or perform a task using data structure to achieve desired results   

## Key Data Structures in Python:  

1. Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items  
2. Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections of items.  
3. Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.  
4. Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements
5. Linked Lists: Linear collections of elements, each linked to the next  
6. Stacks: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structures  
7. Queues: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structures  
8. Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes  
9. Graphs: Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
