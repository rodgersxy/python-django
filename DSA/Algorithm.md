## 1. Tree Traversal Algorithms   
Traversal is a process of visiting all the nodes of a Tree, starting from the root node. A Tree can be traversed in three different ways:   

– In-order traversal involves visiting the subtree on the left first, followed by the root, and then the right subtree. 

– In the pre-order traversal, the first to be visited is the root node, followed by the left subtree, and finally, the right subtree. 

– In the post-order traversal algorithm, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree is visited, with the root node being visited last.    

## 2. Sorting Algorithms    
Sorting algorithms denote the ways to arrange data in a particular format. Sorting ensures that data searching is optimized to a high level and that the data is presented in a readable format. Let us look at the five different types of Sorting algorithms in Python:    

Bubble Sort – This algorithm is based on comparison in which there is repeated swapping of adjacent elements if they are in an incorrect order.
Merge Sort – Based on the divide and conquer algorithm, Merge sort divides the Array into two halves, sorts them, and then combines them.
Insertion Sort – This sorting begins with comparing and sorting the first two elements. Then, the third element is compared with the two previously sorted elements and so on.
Shell Sort – It is a form of Insertion sort, but here, far away elements are sorted. A large sub-list of a given list is sorted, and the size of the list is progressively reduced until all the elements are sorted. 
Selection Sort – This algorithm begins by finding the minimum value from a list of elements and puts it into a sorted list. The process is then repeated for each of the remaining elements in the list which is unsorted. The new element entering the sorted list is compared with its existing elements and placed at the correct position. The process goes on until all the elements are sorted.    

## 3. Searching Algorithms   
Searching algorithms help in checking and retrieving an element from different data structures. One type of searching algorithm applies the method of sequential search where the list is sequentially traversed, and every element is checked (linear search). In another type, the interval search, elements are searched for in sorted data structures (binary search). Let us look at some of the examples:   
    
Linear Search – In this algorithm, each item is sequentially searched one by one.
Binary Search – The search interval is repeatedly divided in half. If the element to be searched is lower than the central component of the interval, the interval is narrowed to the lower half. Otherwise, it is narrowed to the upper half. The process is repeated until the value is found.   

## 4. Graph Algorithms   
There are two methods of traversing graphs using their edges. These are:  

Depth-first Traversal (DFS) – In this algorithm, a graph is traversed in a depthward motion. When any iteration faces a dead end, a stack is used to go to the next vertex and start a search. DFS is implemented in Python using the set data types.
Breadth-first Traversal (BFS) – In this algorithm, a graph is traversed in a breadthward motion. When any iteration faces a dead end, a queue is used to go to the next vertex and start a search. BFS is implemented in Python using the queue data structure.
